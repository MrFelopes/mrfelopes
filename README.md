## ðŸ‘¤ A little bit about me
Hi, my name is Felipe Redivo Fragoso, I'm 19 years and from Brazil, currently attending college and working as a developer trainee at Ultra LIMS. I also started learning C#.

As for my hobbies/personal tastes, I enjoy reading manga, watching anime and playing games. 

Last but not least, I enjoy a lot of music genres, but in general I usually listen to J-ROCK/J-POP (mostly with VOCALOID vocals), with my favorite producer being DECO*27.
## ðŸŽ¯ Projects
### kurochou.me
**kurochou**.me is the main project i'm working on right now: A website made to watch clips of me and my friends dumb gameplays and laughs. The front-end of the project is being written in Next.js using TypeScript, while the back-end is written in C# with a PostgreSQL database. This project is essentially being made by 2 people: Meiro and myself, but if you want to contribute (or just mess with it), here is the [front-end](https://github.com/Nirvaleissons/kurochou-front) and the [back-end](https://github.com/MrFelopes/kurochou-api). Do keep in mind that you'll need to configure a database for it.

### Claire Juliani (Website)
This was my main project in school, a website for a clothing store called "Claire Juliani" that really exists and already has a website. At first, me and my team started this project with the intention of selling the site to the store owner, as well as using it for school. Unfortunately, after some internal problems, we gave up on selling the site, but still used it for the classes. The back-end of the project (the part I worked on) utilizes MySQL and PHP, while the front-end uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project has features like log-in, account creation, profile editing, product listing, product details (like pricing, sizes, collections and images) and a cart system that displays all the products in the cart as well as the sum of their prices.

### Manga-ko
This project is being worked on as a hobby and I do it on my free time. It's a project of a manga reading app that uses Mangadex's API for retrieving and displaying manga titles, covers, publishing status, chapters, etc.
